## Lazy Sequences

- What is lazy evaluation? (use example of IFTE)
- How is it implemented? (`lazy-seq` and thunks)
- When should you use it?
- Creating lazy sequences:
  - `range`
  - `repeat`
  - `take`
  - `drop`
- Gotchas
  - output of higher order functions
  - benchmarking (WHNF)
  - forcing realization with `do` and `doall`

---

## Key-value functions

- `assoc` and `assoc-in`
- `update`and `update-in`
- `merge` and `merge-with`

---

## Mutation

- `atom` and `swap!`
- `transient` and `persistent!`
